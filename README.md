# [Starters and Saviors](https://starters-and-saviors.vercel.app/)

## Abstract:

Dungeons and Dragons can be hard for new players to learn. This app is an attempt to make the relevant information easily available to a general public, in the form of a readable wiki-style webpage. As an MVP, this app only has the rules for skills and ability scores, but a user can view and access any of the rules pertaining to those features. It is built using React, and uses the [DnD5eAPI](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#overview).
